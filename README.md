## **I.INTRODUCTION**
In this project, a _**operation dashboard**_ was developed using _**Design Thinking**_ approach and _**Power BI**_ tools (**_DAX_**, **_Power Query_**, and **_Visualization_** tools) to analyze **_global sales performance_** over 4 years. The dashboard aimed to assist senior managers in **_understanding business performance by region, product, and sales personnel,_** which led to **_decisions_** in **_Market expansion_**, **_Market optimization_**, and **_Product selection_**.

### **1. BUSINESS QUESTIONS**
Adventure Works Cycles is a bicycle manufacturing company that operates across multiple business functions. Senior management of Adventure Works Cycles requires a detailed understanding of the companyâ€™s procurement efficiency to optimize inventory management and cost control in relation to:

- Ensuring sufficient procurement of raw materials and goods to meet sales demand
- Optimizing purchase costs while maintaining quality standards
- Aligning procurement schedules with production and sales timelines
- Identifying potential inefficiencies in the purchasing process

### **2. DATASET**
The dataset (as attachment) contains global sales information of Superstore, including 3 tables:
- Orders: a table storing transaction information
